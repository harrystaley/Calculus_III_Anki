# Calculus_III_Anki

## Overview

Welcome to the Calculus_III_Anki repository. This project contains a comprehensive Anki deck for Calculus III, designed to help students reinforce and test their knowledge. The deck has been adapted from a variety of reputable educational resources and uses MathJax for formula display to ensure accuracy and clarity. The topics covered in this deck are vast and span the entire Calculus III curriculum.

## Setup and Installation

To use this Anki deck, you need to have Anki installed on your device. Anki is a free and open-source flashcard program that utilizes spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is a learning technique that adjusts the schedule of review to the rate of your learning, which enhances memory and recall.

### Dependencies

- Anki - You can download Anki from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and follow the instructions on the page to install it.
- MathJax - The deck uses MathJax for displaying formulas. Anki should support this out of the box.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip file.
2. Open Anki.
3. Go to File -> Import.
4. Navigate to the location of the cloned or downloaded repository.
5. Select the `.apkg` file and click Open.

## Usage

After importing the deck into Anki, you can start using it immediately. Each card will show a question, and when you click, it will show the answer. You can then rate your performance, and Anki will schedule the next review of that card based on your rating.
